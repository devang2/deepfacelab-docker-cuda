# deepfacelab-docker
Containerized version of DeepFaceLab aimed for a fast workflow

# Quick start

Clone this repository, run the docker-compose command and clear the workspace.

```
git clone https://github.com/lavafroth/deepfacelab-docker.git
cd deepfacelab-docker
docker-compose run app
```

Copy the `data_dst` and `data_src` videos to the workspace folder.
Now run the rest of the scripts sequentially (as numbered).
